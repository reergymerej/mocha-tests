# Mocha Tests

This is a test project so I can learn about [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/).  I'll keep my notes here in the readme.

## Original Project

This was cloned from my [Nice MEAN](https://github.com/reergymerej/nice-mean/) repo, which I recommend for MEAN noobs.

## Notes

Mocha is used for server-side unit tests.
